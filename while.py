# this simple program describes while loop at basics.

i = 0  # 'i' have been given a value as 0 so i will be by default 0 when the program runs
while i <= 10:  # this shows while if i is greater or equals to 10
    # but since 'i' is neither greater nor equals to 0 and thus the condition is false and
    print(i)  # thus here i with default value is 0 and that gets printed
    i = i + 1  # but then 1 gets added to I. the programs loops again from the beginning.
# with the updated value of i that is 1. this keeps on happening till the condition comes out true thus " i <= 10"
